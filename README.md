# Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

# Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bikefrom point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

This solution uses CSV files with data from bike share system provider for major cities in the United States and it uncovers usage patterns.

# Files used
This solution uses CSV files with bicycle-sharing usage data from different cities in the US.

# Common usage information
You can execute the solution by running "python bikeshare.py". Then, it will ask you few questions on what city to analyze, what kind of analysis you want to do etc. Just follow the steps to see the results in your screen.

# Software dependencies
This solution requires the Anaconda packages: **pandas** and **numpy**
